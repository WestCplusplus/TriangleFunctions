<h1>Triangle Functions</h1>

3.7. Create a program that asks the user if they have a right triangle, isosceles, or equilateral. You will be given 2 sides of the triangle. You must write a program that finds the length of the missing side. You must write a program the finds the perimeter, and area of the triangles. 
The program must not end until you type the word STOP. 
Example: Right triangle A side = 5, B side = 6, C side = ??
Output: C side = 7.81
Area of Right triangle = 15
Perimeter of Right triangle = 18.81
Find the square root
